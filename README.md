**RIP Joonku Kang, from your brother Minku Kang**

I've never forgotten you when you write this code as a high school student in Seoul.

You got job offers from California
and some prominent tech companies from Korea when you were even a high schooler.

You had talked about your GitHub even though I did not know about the ABC of machine learning.

He passed away on 16 June 2018.
I miss you Joonku Kang so much.

Best regards,
Minku Kang
