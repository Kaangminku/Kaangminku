**RIP Joonku Kang, from your brother Minku Kang**
<br/>
_http://github.com/junku901/machine_learning_
<br/>
<br/>
I've never forgotten you when you write this code as a high school student in Seoul.
<br/>
<br/>
You got job offers from California <br/>
and some prominent tech companies from Korea when you were even a high schooler.
<br/>
<br/>
You had talked about your GitHub even though I did not know about the ABC of machine learning.
<br/>
<br/>
He passed away on 16 June 2018. <br/>
I miss you Joonku Kang so much.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
Minku Kang<br/>
